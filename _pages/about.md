I am a PhD Candidate in the Department of Physics & Astronomy at the University of California, Irvine.
Previously, I completed my M.S. in Astronomy at San Diego State University, and my B.S. in Physics at the University 
of California, Santa Barbara.

My research primarily concerns the growth and evolution of supermassive black holes. More specifically, I analyze 
integral-field data taken by the Keck Cosmic Web Imager (KCWI) on Keck-II, and map the spatially resolved kinematics
of the gases in the surrounding environment.

In one project, I investigate and compare the kinematics of the ionized [O III] gas in nearby active galaxies ([R. P. Remigio et al. 2025](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adfe5d)). Currently, I am searching for extended Ly-alpha emission around high redshift (z>6.5) quasars using
KCWI's red channel.
