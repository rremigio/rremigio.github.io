I am currently a PhD Candidate in the Department of Physics & Astronomy at the University of California, Irvine.
Previously, I completed my M.S. in Astronomy at San Diego State University.

Using one of the most powerful telescopes in the world, I investigate the evolution of supermassive black holes by examining the motions of gases in their environments.
