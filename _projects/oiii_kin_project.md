<!-- Every project has a beautiful feature showcase page.
#It's easy to include images in a flexible 3-column grid format.
#Make your photos 1/3, 2/3, or full width.

To give your project a background in the portfolio page, just add the img tag to the front matter like so:

One method of probing the co-evolution between supermassive black holes (SMBHs) 
and their host galaxies is investigating the properties of gas photoionized by 
an active galactic nucleus (AGN). At optical wavelengths, the [O III] 5007 
emission line serves as one of the best tracers of AGN activity since it is a
strong, ubiquitous line that can be measured out to high redshifts. 
Additionally, the [O III] line profile often exhibits asymmetries, which are 
indicative of non-gravitational kinematics, such as AGN-driven outflows.


In my first project, I reduced and analyzed integral-field data from the 
Keck Cosmic Web Imager (KCWI) on the Keck-II telescope and mapped the spatially 
resolved stellar and ionized gas kinematics for a sample of ten nearby active 
galaxies. Comparing the kinematics of the stars and the [O III] gas, I found 
that for this sample of galaxies, deviations from disk rotation in the ionized
gas velocity fields were localized to regions close to the nucleus.
